HEAD ->The HEAD is quickly explained. It’s a reference to the active branch. So git knows which branch is currently in use

cat HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master

Description -> you can create a short description of your repository. But it’s pretty irrelevant if you’re not usin
 cat description 
Unnamed repository; edit this file 'description' to name the repository

info->stores the configuration of your repository

Hooks-> some predefined git functions that are executed on certain events

pwd
/Users/saipavan/test/.git/hooks

create a pre-commit
________
cat pre-commit
#!/bin/sh

echo "You are about to commit" $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM)
echo "to" $(git branch --show-current)

while : ; do
    read -p "Do you really want to do this? [y/n] " RESPONSE < /dev/tty
    case "${RESPONSE}" in
        [Yy]* ) exit 0; break;;
        [Nn]* ) exit 1;;
    esac
done
_______

#chmod +x pre-commit

cd ../../

now make changes and commit the file so it will ask for conformation  to commit as we specifed that in hooks
